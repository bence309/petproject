# petproject
It's my DevOps related pet project while jobhunting on Codecool. It is a to-do web application connected to a PostgreSQL database. You can create, update and delete to-dos from the database. 

Please make a .env file in the main directory with your database's URI. Example: DATABASE_URI=postgresql://username:password@host.docker.internal:your_port
